# Cycle-Level-LC3b-Simulator
Cycle level simulator that uses the LC-3b's microcode to simulate its datapath, microprocessor, and memory components

It takes as input an assembly program file and an ASCII file representing the microcode

Unfortunately I have lost the control store excel sheel that elaborates explicitly on what the microcode looks like
